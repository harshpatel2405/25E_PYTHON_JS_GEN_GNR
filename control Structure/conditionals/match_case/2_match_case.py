'''
Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs:
choice
value

Use match-case on choice and apply if-else logic inside each case as per the rules below.

    Rules : 

    Case 1
        If value is even and greater than 10 → print EVEN-LARGE
        Else if value is even → print EVEN-SMALL
        Else → print ODD
    Case 2
        If value is divisible by both 3 and 5 → print THREE-FIVE
        Else if divisible by 3 → print THREE
        Else if divisible by 5 → print FIVE
        Else → print NONE
    Case 3
        If value is negative → print NEGATIVE
        Else if value is 0 → print ZERO
        Else → print POSITIVE
    Default Case
        Print INVALID CHOICE
