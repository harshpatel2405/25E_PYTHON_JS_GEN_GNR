Question 1: Write a Python program to create a Number Guessing Game using only if–else statements.
import random

number = random.randint(1,50)

Requirements :
The program must generate a random number between 1 and 50.
The user must enter one guess only.
Compare the guessed number with the generated number and display messages as per the rules below.

Conditions :
If the guessed number is equal to the random number
→ Print: 🎉 Correct Guess! You Win

If the guessed number is greater than the random number
→ Print: 📈 Too High

If the guessed number is less than the random number
→ Print: 📉 Too Low

If the guessed number is less than 1 or greater than 50
→ Print: ❌ Invalid Guess


Question 2 : ATM Withdrawal Validator . An ATM allows withdrawal based on account balance and withdrawal amount.

Inputs:
  balance
  amount

Output Rules
  If amount ≤ 0
    → Invalid Amount
  If amount > balance
    → Insufficient Balance
  If amount > 40000
    → Daily Limit Exceeded
  If balance − amount < 1000
    → Minimum Balance Violation
  Otherwise
    → Transaction Successful

Question 3 : Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs:

choice
value

Use a match-case statement on choice and apply conditional logic inside each case as per the rules below.

🔹 Rules
Case 1: Temperature Analysis

  If value is below 0
  → print FREEZING

  Else if value is between 0 and 15 (inclusive)
  → print COLD

  Else if value is between 16 and 30 (inclusive)
  → print WARM

  Else
  → print HOT

Case 2: Electricity Bill Slab Evaluation
  If value is ≤ 100 units
  → print LOW-USAGE

  Else if value is between 101 and 300 units
  → print MEDIUM-USAGE

  Else if value is greater than 300 units
  → print HIGH-USAGE

Case 3: Login Attempt Validation
  If value is 0
  → print NO-ATTEMPT

  Else if value is between 1 and 3 (inclusive)
  → print VALID-ATTEMPT

  Else if value is between 4 and 5 (inclusive)
  → print WARNING

  Else
  → print ACCOUNT-BLOCKED

Default Case
  Print INVALID CHOICE
